M²aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK, [biotools:m2aia](https://bio.tools/m2aia), [RRID:SCR_019324](https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_019324)) is a software tool enabling interactive signal processing and visualisation of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) datasets. M²aia extends the open source Medical Imaging and Interaction Toolkit ([MITK](https://mitk.org)) and provides powerful methods that the MSI community can adopt, exploit and improve further. In it's current state, it is designet to enable multi-modal 2D registration and 3D MSI reconstruction.

In addition, M²aia provides features for 

<ul>
  <li> Read/write access to the open standard imzML </li>
  <li> Image interaction and visualization </li>
  <li> Signal processing: Normalization, baseline correction, smoothing and peak picking </li>
  <li> Image segmentation </li>
  <li> Multi-modal 3D reconstruction of MSI images </li>
  <li> Image registration of 2D multi-modal images 
</ul>
